Welcome to the spoken tutorials on PHP \& MySQL.\\
There are 56 Spoken Tutorials in this CD (in English). \\
They are divided into 3 Levels:\\
Level 1: {\tt PHP Basics}\\
Level 2: {\tt MySQL}\\
Level 3: {\tt PHP Advanced}

\section{The procedure to practice}
\begin{enumcpt}
\item You have been given a set of spoken tutorials and files
\item You will typically do one tutorial at a time
\item You may listen to a spoken tutorial and reproduce all the commands shown in the video
\item If you find it difficult to do the above, you may consider
  listening to the \emph{whole} tutorial once and then practise during
  the second hearing
\item Please note that following two things:
\begin{enumcpt}
\item Path of {\tt phpacademy} folder shown in video is:

{\tt C:$\backslash$xampp$\backslash$htdocs$\backslash$phpacademy}

This is your working directory. All the .php and/or .html files should be created/copied in this directory. You are free to create subdirectories here for each video tutorial so that you can manage all your files in a better way.

\item Editor used in video is:{\tt ConTEXT}

Please install ConTEXT editor in your machine.  You have been provided with the installation file in the {\tt install} folder in the {\tt phpandmysql} folder.
\end{enumcpt}
\item All the required material may also be available on a CD.
\end{enumcpt}

\section{Learning Strategy for the spoken tutorials:}
\begin{enumcpt}
\item To begin, please click on {\tt php\_tutorial.html} file in the folder {\tt phpandmysql} for the suggested learning sequence of the tutorials.  
\item Double click to open the file in the browser.  
\item Links for the Script, Spoken Tutorials (Videos), and Codes for each tutorial are given in file {\tt php\_tutorial.html}.  You are not expected to use the script, unless you have difficulty in understanding the pronounciation or to refer to a command in the video. 
\item You can use (copy paste) the given codes while learning and for practicing in the future. 
\item Please remember to click on the link {\tt Spoken Tutorial} to open and view the videos.
\end{enumcpt}

\section{First tutorial: Installing a Webserver with PHP and MySQL (XAMPP in Windows)}
